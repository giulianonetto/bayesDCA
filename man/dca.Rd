dca(
  .data,
  thresholds = seq(0.01, 0.5, 0.01),
  keep_draws = TRUE,
  keep_fit = FALSE,
  prior_p = NULL,

}
\arguments{
\item{.data}{A data.frame with an \code{outcomes} column (0 or 1 for each individual)
and one or more columns with predicted probabilities from each of desired list
of predictive models, or with 0 or 1 indicator from each of desired list of
binary tests.}

\item{thresholds}{Numeric vector with probability thresholds with which
the net benefit should be computed (default is \code{seq(0.01, 0.5, 0.02)}).}

\item{keep_draws}{Logical indicating whether to keep posterior
draws from \code{stanfit} object (default is TRUE).}

\item{keep_fit}{Logical indicating whether to keep \code{stanfit} in
the output (default is FALSE).}

\item{prior_p, prior_se, prior_sp}{Non-negative shape values for
Beta(alpha, beta) priors used for p, Se, and Sp, respectively.
Default is uniform prior for all parameters - Beta(1, 1).
A single vector of the form \code{c(a, b)} can be provided for each.}

\item{summary_probs}{Probabilities used to compute credible intervals (defaults to a 95\% Cr.I.).}

\item{external_prevalence_data}{Vector with two positive integers giving number of diseased and
non-diseased individuals, respectively, from external data (e.g., if analyzing nested case-control data,
this is the number of cases and non-cases in the source population).}

\item{refresh}{Control verbosity of \code{rstan::sampling} (check its help
page for details).}

\item{...}{Arguments passed to \code{rstan::sampling} (e.g. iter, chains).}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{BayesDCAList}
}
\description{
Estimate decision curves for a list of predictive models and/or
binary tests all at once. Necessary to make comparative inferences across
multiple models or tests
using their corresponding posterior draws.

\examples{
data(PredModelData)
fit <- dca(PredModelData, cores = 4)
plot(fit)
